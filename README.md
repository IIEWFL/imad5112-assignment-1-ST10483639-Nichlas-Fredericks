The meal suugestion app is designed to give users convienient and personalised meal suggestions based on the time of day they enter. In todays fast paced world, people often struggle with deciding on what to eat, especially cosidering the level of healthy nutrients you recieve. This app aims to cut down on this indecisiveness by providing the user with the meal


the design used for this app is a pretty simplistic one, it uses a LinearLsyout for the TextView and EditView functions. A second LinearLayout had been inside the origional one and is used to group the buttons together. The chpice od design gives the app a simplified look.

as for the utilisation of GitHub and GitHub actions, i used the Git Bash method by using code such as , git init, git push, and Git pull. Allowing me to upload my app onto GitHub.
